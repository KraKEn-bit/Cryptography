When we talk about Ciphers we think of it like a Puzzle. And believe it or not It is a puzzle. And when you know the patterns and the keys to each puzzle you will realize the deep meaning of those Ciphers! You can try this with your friends so that nobody will know what you guys are trying to do ! ðŸ˜ˆ Though I would suggest not to be slave to the devils! 


**Let's Dive a bit more into the concept behind Ciphers , Codes and their relations**


# **Ciphers vs Codes**


### **Ciphers:**

A method of transforming individual letters, digits, or small groups of text according to a set of rules (an algorithm + a key).Cipher works at the letter or bit level. Cipher depends on an algorithm + key. Cipher: Easier to adapt with new keys, widely used in modern cryptography. Example: Caeser Cypher, VigenÃ¨re Cipher , Modern AES, RSA (work at bit/byte level) .

Process Example: Caesar Cipher shifts each letter by 3 (A â†’ D, B â†’ E). 

### **Codes:**

On the other hand, Codes are a system that replaces entire words, phrases, or sentences with symbols or other words, usually from a codebook.

Example: "Attack at dawn" â†’ "Red Eagle". 

Code works at the word or phrase level.Code depends on a codebook. More Examples: "Apple" = "Attack now" , Military codebooks ("Blue Sky" = "Retreat") etc .
