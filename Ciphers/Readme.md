When we talk about Ciphers we think of it like a Puzzle. And believe it or not It is a puzzle. And when you know the patterns and the keys to each puzzle you will realize the deep meaning of those Ciphers! You can try this with your friends so that nobody will know what you guys are trying to do ! 😈 Though I would suggest not to be slave to the devils! 


**Let's Dive a bit more into the concept behind Ciphers , Codes and their relations**

# **Ciphers vs Codes**


### **Ciphers:**

A method of transforming individual letters, digits, or small groups of text according to a set of rules (an algorithm + a key).Cipher works at the letter or bit level. Cipher depends on an algorithm + key. Cipher: Easier to adapt with new keys, widely used in modern cryptography. Example: Caeser Cypher, Vigenère Cipher , Modern AES, RSA (work at bit/byte level) . So basically a cipher has a specific rule, and that rule would work for whatever things you put into that message,

Process Example: Caesar Cipher shifts each letter by 3 (A → D, B → E). 

Here's a picture of a Cipher Machine which we already discussed in [Ancient Cryptography](https://github.com/KraKEn-bit/Cryptography/tree/main/Ancient_Cryptography) :

### **Codes:**

On the other hand, Codes are a system that replaces entire words, phrases, or sentences with symbols or other words, usually from a codebook.

Example: "Attack at dawn" → "Red Eagle". 

Code works at the word or phrase level.Code depends on a codebook. More Examples: "Apple" = "Attack now" , Military codebooks ("Blue Sky" = "Retreat") etc .


**If you want a more organized way to demonstrate the difference, here's a table that will be easier to know the difference:**


| Feature              | Cipher 🧩 | Code 📖 |
|----------------------|-----------|---------|
| **Definition**       | Transforms individual **letters, numbers, or bits** using rules (algorithm + key) | Replaces entire **words, phrases, or sentences** with symbols/words from a **codebook** |
| **Level of Operation** | Works at the **letter/character/bit** level | Works at the **word/phrase** level |
| **Dependence**       | Requires an **algorithm + key** | Requires a **codebook** |
| **Flexibility**      | Very flexible (change key → new system) | Not flexible (codebook must be updated if compromised) |
| **Security Weakness** | If the key is exposed, cipher is broken | If the codebook is captured, whole system is broken |
| **Examples**         | Caesar Cipher, Vigenère Cipher, AES, RSA | “Red Eagle” = “Attack at dawn”, military/diplomatic codebooks |
| **Modern Usage**     | Dominates modern cryptography (digital security, encryption) | Rare today, used in intelligence, military signals |


### **Note To be Noted:**

In case of Caeser Ciphers, we don’t need a codebook. Instead, we follow a series of instructions—also known as an algorithm—where we shift each letter by a certain number. The algorithm requires one piece of shared information known as a key. In the example above where A→D, the key is four. This shared key is required for two parties to encrypt messages: HELLO → KHOOR, and decrypt messages: KHOOR→HELLO.

 
So, In short: **A cipher changes the literal characters typed in based on some algorithm while a code shortens linguistic constructs based on their meaning.**

### **Let's Face some Questions**

`What is a Codebook?`

Ans:<br>
A codebook is a dictionary or reference list used in codes (not ciphers). It contains predefined substitutions, where specific words, phrases, or sentences are replaced with other words, numbers, or symbols. So instead of sending “Attack at dawn” as a word/Phrase , a messenger would just send “Red Eagle” as a code.

**Only people with the same codebook would understand it.** 

Another famous Example is the **Morse Code** which introduces the idea of a codebook !

# **MORSE CODE**

<br>
<br>

`What is Morse Code?`

Ans:<br>
Morse Code is a system of encoding characters (letters, digits, punctuation) into a sequence of dots (·) and dashes (–).<br> 
Example:  A = · – , B = – · · ·  etc.

<br>
**Let's dive into the History Behind Morse Code**

### **History of MORSE CODE**

Morse code was developed in the 1830s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail for use with the electric telegraph, and the first official message, “What hath God wrought?”, was sent in 1844 between Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. It quickly became the standard for long-distance communication in railroads, the military, and maritime services. By the mid-19th century, International Morse Code was standardized for worldwide use. In the early 20th century, it was essential for radio communication, and after the Titanic disaster in 1912, the SOS signal (· · · – – – · · ·) became the universal distress call. Although gradually replaced by modern digital systems in the late 20th century, Morse code remains a symbolic and practical tool in amateur radio, aviation, and emergency signaling today.

<br>

Ok Let's head back to the main part:

So, the very BASIC thing about **MORSE CODE** is that they are made of **DOTs** and **DASHES** . Different combinations of the Dots and Dashes will produce different Letters. And different combinations of those letters will create **WORDS** .<br>
When you're beeping out each letter, Dot takes **One Beat** and Dashes take up **Three of those Beats** . In this case Tempos Matter !!!

`Why Tempo matters?`

Ans:<br>
Morse code is not just about dots (·) and dashes (–); it’s also about timing. The tempo (speed of sending) ensures that each symbol, letter, and word is distinguishable.

### **The Basics of Timing:**

  -Dot (·) = 1 unit of time<br>
  -Dash (–) = 3 units of time<br>
  -Space between symbols in a letter = 1 unit<br>
  -Space between letters = 3 units<br>
  -Space between words = 7 units<br>

<br>
For example:<br> 
Correct: · – = A <br>
<br>
Too fast: ··– → could be misread as U<br>
Too slow: receiver may think two letters are separate words

<br>

<br>

### **The QUICK and DIRTY METHOD:** 

Let's go through this with a simple story: <br>
**"Rafsan and I sailed over oceans, finding endless adventures in One Piece."**

<br>
We’ll use a simple mapping:<br>

 - Short words (≤3 letters) → dot (·)<br>
 - Long words (>3 letters) → dash (–)

**Here's the demonstration of the words of the story I gave:**
<br>
| Word       | Letters | Symbol |
| ---------- | ------- | ------ |
| Rafsan     | 6       | –      |
| and        | 3       | ·      |
| I          | 1       | ·      |
| sailed     | 6       | –      |
| over       | 4       | –      |
| oceans     | 6       | –      |
| finding    | 7       | –      |
| endless    | 7       | –      |
| adventures | 10      | –      |
| in         | 2       | ·      |
| One        | 3       | ·      |
| Piece      | 5       | –      |

<br>

- **Morse sequence generated:**

– · · – – – – – – · · –

<br>

### **Let's represent this with a Binary Tree:**

Where:<br> 
- **Left child = dot (·)**  
- **Right child = dash (–)**

<br>

Legend: Left = · (dot), Right = – (dash)

                      [Start]
                     /       \
               and (·)         Rafsan (–)
               /     \         /       \
           I (·)     One (·) sailed (–)  over (–)
          /   \               /        \
       in (·) Piece (–)    oceans (–)   finding (–)
                             /     \
                        endless (–)  adventures (–)


**How to read it:**  
- Start at the top.  
- For each **dot (·)**, go **left**.  
- For each **dash (–)**, go **right**.  
- The **leaf node** you reach is the letter.  
<br>

For example:<br>
**Example:** - Morse · – · · = Start → Right (Rafsan) → Left (sailed) → Left (oceans) = **oceans**

Result: oceans
