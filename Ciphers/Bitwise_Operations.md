If you’ve seen the lesson on the one-time pad, you know that it is the ultimate shift cipher. It involves the application of a random list of shifts equal to the length of the message. 
It’s important to understand exactly how and why the one-time pad is unbreakable.

**Bitwise simply means that we are dealing with individual bits, or binary numbers.** 
In any modern/computerized encryption scheme we represent our symbols using binary digits. And here in Cryptography Binary Operations can play a Major role. Specifically we must know why **XOR** must be used when performing the **OTP** on computers.  Bitwise Operations are AND,OR,XOR.
