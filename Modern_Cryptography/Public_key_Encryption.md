**Let's dive into the history of **NORAD** briefly**

NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) was created in 1958 as a joint U.S.–Canada military command to defend North America from Soviet bombers and later missiles during the Cold War. Headquartered in Colorado’s Cheyenne Mountain, it coordinated radar warning lines and fighter interceptions. After the Cold War, NORAD adapted to new missions such as monitoring airspace for smuggling, and following 9/11, expanded to include homeland air defense against terrorism. Today, it provides aerospace warning, control, and maritime warning for both nations, making it one of the strongest examples of U.S.–Canada defense cooperation.
