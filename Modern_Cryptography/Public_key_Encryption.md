**Let's dive into the history of **NORAD** briefly**

NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) was created in 1958 as a joint U.S.–Canada military command to defend North America from Soviet bombers and later missiles during the Cold War. Headquartered in Colorado’s Cheyenne Mountain, it coordinated radar warning lines and fighter interceptions. After the Cold War, NORAD adapted to new missions such as monitoring airspace for smuggling, and following 9/11, expanded to include homeland air defense against terrorism. Today, it provides aerospace warning, control, and maritime warning for both nations, making it one of the strongest examples of U.S.–Canada defense cooperation.

`What's a PUBLIC KEY ENCRIPTION?`

Ans:

Public key encryption—also known as asymmetric cryptography—uses a mathematically linked key pair: a public key, which is shared openly, and a private key, which remains secret. Only the private key holder can decrypt messages encrypted with the public key, and only the corresponding private key can create valid digital signatures that can be verified using the public key.

`How it Works?`

Ans:

  - Key Generation: A cryptographic algorithm generates a public-private key pair 
  
  - Encryption: Anyone can encrypt a message using the recipient's public key; only the recipient with the private key can decrypt it 

  - Digital Signatures: The private key can sign data to prove authenticity, while anyone can verify the signature using the public key

  - Hybrid Systems: Because asymmetric cryptography is computationally heavier, it’s typically used to securely exchange a symmetric key,     which is then used for faster bulk data encryption

## **APLICATIONS:**

  - web Security (HTTPS/TLS): Establishes secure connections where the website shares its public key via SSL/TLS certificates; a session       key is created and encrypted using public key encryption 

  - Email Encryption: Tools like PGP use public key systems to protect privacy and provide identity verification 

  - Cryptocurrencies: Public keys act as wallet addresses, and private keys authorize transactions 

  - Digital Signatures & Authentication: Validates the identity of senders and ensures message integrity 

  - Key Distribution & VPNs: Protocols like Diffie-Hellman facilitate secure key exchange over untrusted networks

## **COMMON ALGORITHMS IT USES:**

Ans:

  - RSA: Based on the tough problem of factoring large integers. Widely used in signing and key exchange 

  - Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC): Offers similar security to RSA but with much smaller keys—efficient and widely adopted

  - Post-Quantum Cryptography: New algorithms are being developed to withstand powerful quantum computing attacks, as current schemes like     RSA and ECC could become vulnerable
