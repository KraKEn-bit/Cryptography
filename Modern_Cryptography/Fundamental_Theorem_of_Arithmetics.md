`In prehistoric, How did we track of time  without a clock? `<br>
Ans:<br>
(In the perspective of Prehistoric Timeline) Actually all clocks are based on repeatative patterns that divide the whole time in several equal segments. To find these patterns we look up to the sky to get a clearer look. **The Sun rising and falling each day** can be a crystal example.  <br>
however to keep track of longer period of times we looked for longer cycles. **Looking into the Moon** was one of the perfect examples.<br> 
It seemed to gradually grow and shrink over many days. When we count the days for a Full Moon , we arrive at the number 29 that is the origin of the month. <bn>

**To break 29 into equal pieces is to break it back down into single units.**<br>

Now, **NOTICE:**
29 is a prime number. we can't break it into more than 2 parts as it obeys the rules of **"PRIME NUMBERS** . <br>

**If we can break a number into more than 2 equal parts then they are called composite numbers.** 


Now,

`To break 29 into equal pieces is to break it back down into single units. What does it mean actually?`<br>
Ans:<br>
It means trying to divide it into groups of the same size. Since 29 is prime, you can‚Äôt do that with whole numbers except in the trivial ways.<br>
A prime number is one that cannot be broken into equal whole-number pieces (other than the trivial cases of 1 and itself).<br>
If you try, you‚Äôll always get fractions.

So for  29: <br>
The only ‚Äúequal pieces‚Äù possible are:

29 ones ‚Üí 1+1+1+...+1 (29 times)

That means: 1 group of  29

Nothing else works.


Now a quention may arise:<br>
`How many prime numbers are there and how big can they get?` <br>
Ans: <br>

**1. How many prime numbers are there?**


There are infinitely many prime numbers.

This was first proven by Euclid around 300 BCE. His proof is beautiful and simple:

Assume there are only finitely many primes: p1,p2,p3,...pn. <br>
Multiply them together and add 1 : <br> 
N = p1 * p2 * p3 * ... * pn +1 <br>

Now, 
N is not divisible by any of the primes in your list . So either N itself is prime, or it has prime factors not in your list ‚Üí contradiction.<br>
Therefore, primes must be infinite.


**How big can Prime numbers get?** <br>
Ans:<br>

Primes get arbitrarily large. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúlargest prime.‚Äù However, the primes become less frequent as numbers get bigger. The Prime Number Theorem says that the number of primes less than ùëõ . 
n is approximately:   

œÄ(n) ‚àº n/ln(n)

(where œÄ(n) counts primes up to ùëõ).

For example:<br>
 - Upto 10 there are 4 primes.
 - Upto 1000 there are 168 primes.

**The largest known prime (as of 2025) is a Mersenne prime of the form:**

2^p - 1

**The current record-holder (found in 2018) is:

 2 ^77,232,917 -1 
 
 almost 23 millions!!!
