## **What is Cryptography?**

Let's Explain this with a Simple Example of Data Transmission between Alice and Bob where a person named Eve will try to intercept the informations bewtween them:

Alice Shares a code with Bob that only Bob will have access to the datas. This is called **ENCRYPTION** . Bob will then use the code to access the data. This is called **DECRYPTION** . 

The codes will be created in such a way that even if a 3rd person named Eve tries to intercept the messages that is being transfarred between Bob and Alice, he will fail as those messages will seem meaningless to him. Example: **Caeser Cipher** .

But then a major breakthrough was made after 800 years by the acquiring the method called **FREQUENCY ANALYSIS** .
